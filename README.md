## Installing Plugins in ProcessMaker
To install these plugins, download the **.tar** file and login to ProcessMaker as
a user with the PM_SETUP permission in her role (such as the "admin" user). 
Then, go to **Admin > Plugins > Plugin Manager** and click on the **Import** button 
and select the **.tar** file to upload it to ProcessMaker. Once uploaded, then select 
the plugin in the list and click on **Enable**.
